### Case Study: Every Second Counts for Hungry Customers
Competition in the food delivery market is fierce, particularly with the impact of pandemic-weary consumers and hindered demand for dine-in restaurants. As of 2020, DoorDash has the largest market share of 45%, followed closely by the combined shares of Uber Eats and Postmates at 37% (following a July 2020 acquisition).

The current market provides an opportunity to innovate by making improvements in UI/UX of both food delivery websites and applications.

A [study](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/the-need-for-speed) by Nielsen Norman Group emphasizes that despite an increase in internet speeds, page load times have not meaningfully improved over time. This is important because "the effects of slow-loading web pages on site abandonment and conversion has been proven time and again" as supported by the following studies:

- [Google](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-resources/data-measurement/mobile-page-speed-new-industry-benchmarks/) found 53% of mobile visits ended if a page took **longer than 3 seconds** to load.
- [Mozilla](https://blog.mozilla.org/metrics/2010/04/05/firefox-page-load-speed-part-ii/) experiment which found that **reducing the page load time by 2 seconds led to 15% higher conversion**.
- [Akamai](https://www.akamai.com/us/en/multimedia/documents/report/akamai-state-of-online-retail-performance-2017-holiday.pdf) aggregated data from 17 retailers (7 billion pageviews) and found that **conversion rates were highest for pages that loaded in less than 2 seconds**; longer load times correlated with 50% drops in conversion rates and increased bounce rates, especially for mobile visitors.

### Making UI/UX Improvements
This experiment was conducted using the B2B or merchant websites from a handful of popular food delivery companies. I chose the website for the market leader and converted the existing [DoorDash B2B website](https://get.doordash.com) to a new CMS and tech stack, with the goal of measuring hypothetical improvements against its competitors.

### Lighthouse Test Results

[Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) is an open-source, automated tool built into Chrome for measuring and improving the quality of web pages. Lighthouse has audits for:

- Performance (incl. speed)
- Accessibility
- Best Practices
- SEO

[Firefox Developer Tools](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools) were used to measure transferred data size (in KB or MB) and [load event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Network_Monitor/request_list) (in milliseconds or seconds).

### CRO and Calculating the Cost of Speed
On the consumer side DoorDash customers spent $36 per transaction, while Grubhub customers spent the highest average price per transaction at $41 and UberEats trailed at $31. While the respective app stores (Apple and Google Play) and the delivery apps themselves are important launchpads for consumer purchases, the B2B or merchant websites are ultimately the last-mile or gatekeepers for new restaurant sign-ups.

<img align="right" width="450" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hdehal/doordash-poc/master/static/edison_prices.png">

With DoorDash having a market share of 45% and revenue upwards of $900m per year, reducing the page load time by merely 2 seconds could lead to a higher merchant *conversion rate optimization* (CRO) of 15% (per Mozilla) up to 50%+ (per Akamai and Google).

### Conclusion

In conclusion, improving the B2B websites with an emphasis on performance, accessibility (a11y), internationalization (i18n), SEO, and overall UI/UX best practices can help capture tens of millions of dollars in revenue by optimizing merchant conversion rates (CRO), which are extremely vulnerable to *hungry* (or *hangry*) customers impacted by speed or other accessibility issues. Ultimately, with food delivery, every second counts for hungry customers.
